# SimpleFood
### What is it?
* This app is designed to teach the art of simple cooking. Using Alice Waters' The Art of Simple Cooking as a resource, this app illustrates how easy and simple it is, to cook yummy, nutritious and basic foods.
* It focuses on the principle that food is about the quality of the ingredients being put into it, and if one procures good ingredients, it is so simple to create delicious meals. 
* This app has five different features: It has two collection views that illustrate tools and ingredients, one table view with basic recipes for a variety of dishes, one mapview to find a farmers' market near you, and one view controller describing the nine pillars of simple food.
* This app is designed for all ages and anyone who has any sort of eagerness to cook simply and delciously!

### What did I learn?
* I learned how to create collection views and import images as icons as well as convert an API into locations on a map.
